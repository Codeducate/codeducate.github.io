	<h4 class="hi">Robots are a new technology that only a few people can know.</h4>
	<h4 class="hi">There are only 3 famous robots that have passed testing and are ready to be used.  They are Asimo, HPR, and NAO.</h4>
	<h3 class="Top3Robots">Asimo</h3>
	<p class="turquoise">Honda worked on its humanoid robot starting in 1986, and finally in the year 2000, the first ASIMO robot was introduced to the public. Today, ASIMO can perform a number of impressive tasks. These include running, climbing stairs, reaching and grasping for objects, and comprehending and following basic commands.</p>

	<h3 class="Top3Robots">HPR-4C</h3>
	<p class="turquoise">HPR-4C is more slim and advanced than the Honda Asimo. It can do all the tasks ASIMO can do except at a more advanced level.  It is made of 34 flexible joints in total. There are also sensors on its face that sense motion.  This robot can help with chores around the house</p>
