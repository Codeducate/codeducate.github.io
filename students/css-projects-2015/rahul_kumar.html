				Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.
				The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and then only in their penalty area. Outfield players mostly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may use their head or torso to strike the ball instead. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time and/or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863. Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football
				Today, football is played at a professional level all over the world. Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams, while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet. A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football. Football has the highest global television audience in sport.

				The earliest known football-type game in Europe was Phaininda, an ancient Greek game that was first recorded in the fourth century BCE by Antiphanes (c.408 to 334 BCE).[8] Phaininda was similar to the Greek game Episkyros. An image of an Episkyros player taken from an ancient stone carving held by the Acropolis Museum appears on the UEFA European Championship Cup. Athenaeus, writing in 228 AD, stated the Roman ball game Harpastum  was a version of Phaininda. As with pre-codified "Mob Football", the antecedent of all modern football codes, these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking. According to FIFA the competitive game cuju is the earliest form of football for which there is scientific evidence. Documented evidence of an activity resembling football can be found in the Chinese military manual Zhan Guo Ce compiled between the third and second century BC. Players were tasked with kicking a ball into a net affixed to bamboo poles, using only their feet, chest, back or shoulders. Non-competitive games included kemari in Japan, chuk-guk in Korea and woggabaliri in Australia.
				The world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup, which was founded by C. W. Alcock and has been contested by English teams since 1872. The first official international football match also took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in Glasgow, again at the instigation of C. W. Alcock. England is also home to the world's first football league, which was founded in Birmingham in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor. The original format contained 12 clubs from the Midlands and Northern England.
